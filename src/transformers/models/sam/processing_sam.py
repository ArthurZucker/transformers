    Constructs a SAM processor which wraps a BLIP image processor and an OPT/T5 tokenizer into a single processor.

    [`BlipProcessor`] offers all the functionalities of [`SamImageProcessor`] and [`AutoTokenizer`]. See the docstring
    of [`~BlipProcessor.__call__`] and [`~BlipProcessor.decode`] for more information.

    Args:
        image_processor (`SamImageProcessor`):
            An instance of [`SamImageProcessor`]. The image processor is a required input.
        tokenizer (`AutoTokenizer`):
            An instance of ['PreTrainedTokenizer`]. The tokenizer is a required input.
